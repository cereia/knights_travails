# knights_travails

The goal of this project is to use a graph data structure to create the knight_moves function.

#knight_moves(start, end) takes two pairs of coordinates and returns the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all the squares the knight will stop on along the way on an 8x8 board.
